# phase-rotation-test
Testing out allpass filters and FFT phase manipulation for phase rotation in audio signals.

Currently tested phase rotation using FFTs on sinewaves and sawtoothwaves. To easily manipulate audio signals I've used the JUCE framework. Not much time has been spent on extensibility or performance. Builds of the first test can be found inside the "Builds" folder.
